<h1> Brandon Past, Present and Future </h1>

<h2> Past </h2>

<p><img class="left" src="basketball.png" alt="bastketball">  My past is pretty simple. I liked playing outside and I did pretty well in elementary and middle school.
  I liked to read a lot in elementary school and I played sports at the <a href="https://www.ymcagreenville.org/"> YMCA </a> ,
  I stopped in middle school though and focused more on school. I also developed an interest in video games when I was a kid.
  And that was basically my early life, video games, books, school and sports at the Y.
</p>

<h3> List of Things from my Past </h3>
<ol>
  <li> I got a Wii </li>
  <li> I played Basketball at the YMCA </li>
  <li> Started School </li>
  <li> I Slept a Lot </li>

<h2> Present </h2>

<p> <img class "right" src="youtube.png" alt="youtube"> The lives of my family members are a lot more interesting than my own life, probably because I'm the youngest and don't do much.
Currently what I do a lot is watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> Youtube</a> , hang out with friends and play video games. I also watch a decent amount of basketball.  </p>

<p><img class="right" src="ps4.png" alt="ps4">I also developed an interest for video games as I grew up, I play PS4 with my friends all the time.
  To be honest I'm pretty sure I play too much and too often. I also game on my PC that I have.


<h2> Future </h2>
<p>  In the future I plan on going to college and getting a job. I'm not entirely sure what I want to be when I grow up,
  My main goal for the future is to get <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/money"> MONEY</a>. I don't care how I get it, I'm just trying to get money. A wise man once said "Cash rules everything around me" <img class "left" src="money.jpg" alt"money" >
Cash runs the world and I plan on having a lot of it. </p>
